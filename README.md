# custom_invoice
dynamic invoice that calculates tax, totals, and displays before and after photos, and time and material work for construction companies 

This is an invoice section of a seperate application that was used to automate and modernize the process of ticketing 
and invoicing for construction companies. The demo uses html5, bootstrap, and javascript on the front end 
and php and mysql on the backend.
The demo is connected to a live database and can thus be played with at the link below :)
